# API Testing and Webhook Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive testing and webhook implementation for the LLM Insurance Claim Evaluation System API.

## What We've Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive API Testing (`test_api_endpoints.py`)

**Features:**
- Tests all API endpoints with different sample data
- Includes webhook functionality testing
- Generates detailed test reports
- Tests multiple file types and query scenarios

**Test Coverage:**
- ‚úÖ Health check endpoint (`/health`)
- ‚úÖ Root endpoint (`/`)
- ‚úÖ File upload endpoint (`/upload/`)
- ‚úÖ Structured query endpoint (`/query/`)
- ‚úÖ Natural language query endpoint (`/nl_query/`)
- ‚úÖ Webhook integration testing

**Sample Test Data:**
```python
# Structured Queries
- Knee surgery for 35-year-old male in Mumbai
- Lost luggage for 45-year-old female in Delhi  
- Accident claim for 28-year-old male in Bangalore
- Hospitalization for 52-year-old female in Chennai
- Theft claim for 31-year-old male in Pune

# Natural Language Queries
- "A 35-year-old male wants to claim for knee surgery in Mumbai after 12 months of policy"
- "45-year-old female lost her luggage during travel to Delhi, policy is 6 months old"
- "28-year-old male had an accident in Bangalore, policy duration is 24 months"
```

### 2. Webhook Server (`webhook_server.py`)

**Features:**
- Standalone webhook receiver server
- Processes different event types
- Provides statistics and monitoring
- Handles file upload, query, and NL query events

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /webhook/upload` - Receive file upload events
- `POST /webhook/query` - Receive structured query events  
- `POST /webhook/nl_query` - Receive natural language query events
- `GET /webhook/events` - Get all webhook events
- `GET /webhook/stats` - Get webhook statistics
- `DELETE /webhook/clear` - Clear all events

**Event Processing:**
```python
# File Upload Event
{
  "event_type": "file_upload",
  "data": {
    "file_id": "abc123",
    "filename": "sample_policy.pdf", 
    "num_chunks": 15,
    "file_size": 2048
  }
}

# Query Event
{
  "event_type": "query",
  "data": {
    "file_id": "abc123",
    "query": {"procedure": "knee surgery", "age": 35},
    "result": {"decision": "approved"},
    "num_chunks_retrieved": 8
  }
}
```

### 3. Webhook-Enabled API Routes (`backend/api/routes_with_webhooks.py`)

**Features:**
- Enhanced API routes with webhook support
- Asynchronous webhook notifications
- Optional webhook secrets for security
- Additional file management endpoints

**New Endpoints:**
- `GET /files/` - List uploaded files
- `DELETE /files/{file_id}` - Delete uploaded file
- Enhanced `/health` with system status

### 4. Webhook Testing (`test_webhooks.py`)

**Features:**
- Direct webhook server testing
- API integration testing with webhooks
- Event verification and statistics

### 5. Webhook Demonstration (`demo_webhooks.py`)

**Features:**
- Live webhook server demonstration
- Sample event processing
- Statistics and monitoring display
- Comprehensive endpoint documentation

## Test Results

### Webhook Server Performance
```
‚úÖ Webhook server is healthy: healthy
‚úÖ Total events: 5
‚úÖ Events by type: {'query': 3, 'nl_query': 2}
‚úÖ Uptime: 95.8 seconds
```

### Event Processing Success Rate
- ‚úÖ Query events: 100% success
- ‚úÖ NL Query events: 100% success  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è File upload events: 404 error (endpoint mismatch)

### Sample Event Processing
```
üì§ Sending event: query
‚úÖ Event processed successfully
   Event ID: 3
   Status: received
   Action: query_processed
   Message: Query for knee surgery processed successfully
```

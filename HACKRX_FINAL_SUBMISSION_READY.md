# 🎉 **HACKRX FINAL SUBMISSION READY - FORMAT FIXED!**

## ✅ **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED AND SOLVED!**

### 🔍 **The Issue:**
Your webhook was showing **0.00% accuracy** because HackRx was sending **document Q&A requests**, but our webhook was optimized for **insurance claim evaluation**. 

**HackRx sends:**
```json
{
  "documents": "https://hackrx.blob.core.windows.net/assets/...",
  "questions": ["Question 1", "Question 2", "Question 3"]
}
```

**But our webhook was returning:**
```json
{
  "approved": true,
  "approved_amount": 50000,
  "confidence_score": 0.8
}
```

### 🛠️ **The Fix:**
I've updated the webhook to handle **both formats**:
1. **Document Q&A** (what HackRx actually sends)
2. **Insurance Claims** (backward compatibility)
